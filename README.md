## Goal

We want to build a Linux system from Scratch as described in the Linux From Scratch (LFS) book using Bazel as the build system.

## Why Bazel?

Bazel is a highly scalable build system that is typically used for large, complex builds. Using Bazel to manage the steps in LFS can make things reproducible and more efficient by using caching, parallelism, and dependency management.
